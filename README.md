An intelligent Windows auto-shutdown utility that monitors CPU and network activity to automatically shut down your system during periods of inactivity. Perfect for energy saving, server management, and unattended operations.

> [!WARNING] 
> This application will shut down your computer automatically. Always save your work and ensure proper configuration before use. The application provides countdown warnings, but use responsibly.

- **NPM**: Version 6.0.0 or higher
- **Administrator Privileges**: Required for shutdown commands

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ttwrpz/inactivity-shutdown-windows.git
cd inactivity-shutdown-windows

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Usage

```bash
# Start the application
npm start

# Run in development mode with enhanced logging
npm run dev
```

### First Run Setup

On first launch, you'll be guided through an interactive configuration setup:

```
Configuration Setup
Config > Status checking interval (seconds): (5)
Config > Average calculation reset interval (seconds): (60)
Config > Number of consecutive low-activity checks before shutdown: (12)
Config > Shutdown countdown timer (seconds): (60)
Config > Maximum CPU usage threshold (%): (10)
Config > Maximum network usage threshold (Mbps): (1)
Config > Enable debug logging: (false)
```

## Configuration Options

| Parameter                      | Description                            | Default    | Range        |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------|--------------|
| `trigger_interval`             | How often to check system activity     | 5 seconds  | 1-300s       |
| `average_interval_reset`       | When to reset statistical averages     | 60 seconds | 30-3600s     |
| `trigger_shutdown_times`       | Consecutive low-activity checks needed | 12 times   | 3-100        |
| `trigger_shutdown_countdown`   | Delay before actual shutdown           | 60 seconds | 10-300s      |
| `trigger_cpu_usage_target`     | Maximum CPU usage threshold            | 10%        | 1-50%        |
| `trigger_network_usage_target` | Maximum network usage threshold        | 1 Mbps     | 0.1-100 Mbps |
| `debug`                        | Enable detailed console logging        | false      | true/false   |

## How It Works

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Samples CPU usage every second using moving averages
- Monitors network transmission and reception rates
- Automatically detects and uses primary network interface

### 2. **Intelligence Layer**
- Uses circular buffer algorithms for stable readings
- Requires minimum data points before making decisions
- Calculates rolling averages over configurable time windows

### 3. **Decision-Making**
- Triggers when **both** CPU and network usage fall below thresholds
- Requires consecutive low-activity readings to prevent false positives
- Provides countdown warnings with option to cancel

### 4. **Shutdown Process**
- Executes Windows shutdown command with configurable delay
- Displays farewell message and final status
- Gracefully closes all monitoring processes

## Example Usage Scenarios

### **Home Media Server**
```
CPU Threshold: 5%
Network Threshold: 0.5 Mbps
Check Interval: 10 seconds
Trigger Count: 18 times (3 minutes of inactivity)
```

### **Development Workstation**
```
CPU Threshold: 15%
Network Threshold: 2 Mbps
Check Interval: 5 seconds
Trigger Count: 24 times (2 minutes of inactivity)
```

### **Render Farm Node**
```
CPU Threshold: 2%
Network Threshold: 0.1 Mbps
Check Interval: 30 seconds
Trigger Count: 10 times (5 minutes of inactivity)
```

### Configuration File

The application stores settings in `app.config.json`. You can manually edit this file:

```json
{
  "settings_version": "3.0.0",
  "trigger_interval": 5,
  "average_interval_reset": 60,
  "trigger_shutdown_times": 12,
  "trigger_shutdown_countdown": 60,
  "trigger_cpu_usage_target": 10,
  "trigger_network_usage_target": 1,
  "debug": false
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Application doesn't detect network activity
- **Solution**: Run as Administrator to access network statistics
- **Alternative**: Check Windows Firewall settings

**Issue**: Shutdown command fails
- **Solution**: Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows scripts
- **Command**: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

**Issue**: CPU readings seem inaccurate
- **Solution**: Enable debug mode to see real-time statistics
- **Check**: Task Manager to compare readings

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to see detailed information:

```json5
{
  "debug": true // Modify app.config.json
} 
```

Debug output shows:
- Real-time CPU and network statistics
- Moving average calculations
- Trigger condition evaluations
- Internal state changes

## Status Indicators

The application uses color-coded console output:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: System active, normal operation
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Configuration values and statistics
- ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Low activity warnings with countdown
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Shutdown initiated
- ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Debug information and statistics
- âšª **Gray**: Background processes and resets

## Safety Features

- **Graceful shutdown handling** with proper cleanup
- **Signal handling** for CTRL+C and system termination
- **Error recovery** with automatic restart capabilities
- **Validation** of all configuration inputs
- **Countdown warnings** with clear time remaining
- **Activity detection** cancels pending shutdowns immediately
